## User

The `User` model corresponds to a utility login. If your user has multiple utility logins, say a PG&E login and an SCE login, they must go through the [Connect](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/overview) flow multiple times. Each of these utility logins will be associated with a Pelm `User`.

## Account

The `Account` model corresponds to an account under a utility login. There is typically a one-to-one mapping of `Account` to property. If a user has a residential home, a rental home, and a vacation home, these would correspond to three different Pelm `Account` objects.

Interval data is associated with an `Account`.

## Common scenarios

Bob owns three houses in the Bay Area. PG&E serves gas and electricity for each of his houses. Bob would need to go through the Connect flow once. One Pelm `User` will be created for Bob and it will be associated with three `Account` objects.

Alice lives in Southern California. SCE provides her electricity and SoCal Gas provides her gas. Alice would need to go through the Connect flow twice. Two different Pelm `User` objects will be created for Alice. One will be associated with an SCE `Account` object and the other will be associated with a SoCal Gas `Account` object.
