description: "Before you can request data for a given user, that user must connect their utility account and authorize you access to their data via Connect."

The goal of Connect is for you to receive an `access_token` that you can use to make requests for a given user's data. More info [here](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/user-authorization).

The UI for Connect is provided by Pelm. All you need to do is integrate Connect into your application via one of these methods:

- [Embedding Connect into your application](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/embedding-connect)
- [Redirecting users to https://connect.pelm.com](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/redirecting-to-connect).
