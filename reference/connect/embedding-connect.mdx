title: "Embedding Connect"
---

One method of implementing Connect is by embedding it in your application, either via a script tag or the `react-pelm-connect` npm library. Here are the steps to achieving this:

1. Embed Connect in your application
2. Create a Connect token
3. Open Connect
4. User inputs utility credentials
5. Retrieve an authorization code
6. Exchange code for an access token

## Embed Connect in your application

#### React applications

You can view the repo for our convenient React wrapper [here](https://github.com/Pelm-Technologies/react-pelm-connect). Install via npm:

```bash Terminal
npm install --save react-pelm-connect
```

#### Javascript applications

Embed Connect with a `script` tag. This will create the global window variable `PelmConnect`.

```html HTML
<script src="https://api.pelm.com/connect/pelm-connect.js"></script>
```

## Create a Connect token

The first step is creating a Connect token. This is an extra security measure that abstracts away information like your `Pelm-Client-Id` and `user_id` from the web client.

To retrieve a Connect token, make a POST request to the [/auth/connect_token](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/post%5Fauth-connect-token) endpoint:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.pelm.com/auth/connect-token -H "Pelm-Client-Id: {CLIENT_ID}" -H "Pelm-Secret: {CLIENT_SECRET}" -F "user_id={YOUR_USER_ID}" -F "utility_id={UTILITY_ID}"
```

You must include your own unique identifier for your user in the query parameters. This identifier is how you'll be able to associate responses from API endpoints with a particular user record stored in your records.

Pelm will infer which flow (either **update** or **create**) your user will see based on the `user_id` you pass. In **create** mode, the user will see the following screens:

- Terms of Service Screen (accepting terms of service)
- Utility Selection Screen (selecting a utility)
- Credentials Screen (entering utility credentials)

In **update** mode, the user will start directly at the Utility Selection Screen.

If you submit a new `user_id` for a user that has already connected their account with you, your previously submitted `user_id` will be overwritten by the new value. Make sure you change this appropriately in your records.

Include the optional `utility_id` parameter if you want your User to skip the Utility Selection Screen. You can find a list of `utility_id`s [here](/reference/utilities).

Connect Tokens expire after 30 minutes.

## Open Connect

#### Config object

The config is used to specify your Connect token and callbacks for the success and exit cases. You can find a full Connect API reference [here](https://github.com/Pelm-Technologies/react-pelm-connect#api-reference).

Once your user completes this flow, your `onSuccess` callback will be called with an authorization `code`. You will need to exchange this `code` for an `access_token` in order to access API resources.

The Config option takes in the following parameters.

- `connectToken`: the Connect token created in the previous step
- `onSuccess`: called when your User successfully connects their utility account
- This callback should take an `authorizationCode: string` parameter, which you'll use to get an [access_token](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/post%5Fauth-token-1)
- `onExit`: called when Connect is exited but your user has not successfully connected their utility account
- This callback will be called if your user manually exits Connect or if an error occurs causing Connect to close

Example Config object:

`config: Config = { connectToken: 'CONNECT_TOKEN', onSuccess: (authorizationCode: string) => {...}, onExit: () => {} } `

Once you've created the config object, you can initialize Connect in a few ways.

#### Hook Implementation

Implementation using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

```js JavaScript
import { useConnect, Config } from 'pelm-connect';

const Connect = (props: Props) => {
const config: Config = {
connectToken: 'YOUR_CONNECT_TOKEN',
onSuccess: (authorizationCode: string) => {...},
onExit: () => {...}
}

    const { open, ready, error } = useConnect(config);

    return <button
        type="button"
        className="button"
        onClick={() => open()}
        disabled={!ready}
    >
        Connect your utility
    </button>

}

export default Connect
```

#### Styled Button

We also provide a styled button you can use.

```js JavaScript
import { ConnectButton, Config } from 'pelm-connect';

const Connect = (props: Props) => {
const config: Config = {
connectToken: 'YOUR_CONNECT_TOKEN',
onSuccess: (authorizationCode: string) => {...},
onExit: () => {...}
}

    return <ConnectButton config={config} />

}

export default Connect
```

#### Via script

For non-react applications

```html HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Pelm Connect javascript example</h1>
    <button onClick="launchPelm()">Connect utility</button>
    <script src="https://api.pelm.com/connect/pelm-connect.js"></script>
    <script>
      const launchPelm = async function () {
        const connectToken = "YOUR_CONNECT_TOKEN";
        const onSuccess = (authorizationCode) => {
          // exchange authorization code for access_token
        };
        const onExit = () => {};

        const config = {
          connectToken,
          onSuccess,
          onExit,
        };

        const pelm = await window.PelmConnect.create(config);
        pelm.open();
      };
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Retrieve code

Upon your user successfully completing the Connect flow, your `onSuccess` callback will be called with an `authorizationCode`. Your frontend should pass this `authorizationCode` to your server.

## Exchange code for an access token

An `access_token` gives you access to a given user's data.

To exchange an authorization `code` for an `access_token`, make a POST request to `https://api.pelm.com/auth/token` [(API reference)](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/post%5Fauth-token-1). In the request body, include the `code`. You also need to include a `grant_type` parameter set to "code".

The `code` is the string you retrieved in the previous step.

Add your `Pelm-Client-Id` and `Pelm-Secret` in the header. For example:

```bash cURL
curl --data "code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}&grant_type=code" https://api.pelm.com/tokens -H "Pelm-Client-Id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -H "Pelm-Secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

If you've done this correctly, you'll receive the `access_token`:

```json JSON
{
  "access_token": "57f20230-4ee7-11ec-9b0c-acde48001122",
  "access_token_expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "aea9b417e72b3978c5bfcd0782c3a486ec63abf5e85ce9a62ba36d1b18b12488",
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 1314000
}
```

Note that the `access_token` **will not expire**. You should securely store this token in your database.

You can ignore all the other fields in this response: `access_token_expires_in`, `refresh_token`, `refresh_token_expires_in`. They're included for legacy applications.

## Next steps

Now that you have your `access_token`, you can start making requests for your user's data. Request your user's accounts via [/accounts](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/get%5Faccounts).
