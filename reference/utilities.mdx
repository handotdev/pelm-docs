### Supported Functionality

Pelm's API tries to maintain feature parity amongst all utilities. However, sometimes a utility may not support a specific data field or function. This section outlines function compatibility with different utilities.

An empty field implies that the specified feature is not supported for the utility.

15 min granularity does not imply that all Users for a given utility will have interval data with that level of granularity. e.g., for PGE, some users have 15-minute intervals available while others have 1-hour intervals.

Usage data availability describes how soon usage data becomes available. PGE has a 24-hour delay, which means Monday's usage data will become available Wednesday 2 am PST. ConEd data is available the next day, which means Monday's usage data will become available Tuesday 2am PST.
