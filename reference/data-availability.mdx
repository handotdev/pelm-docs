The initial request to fetch `Account` objects via `/accounts` may take a few seconds to synchronously return a response. In rare instances, this initial request will time out and return a 500 error with error code `data_unavailable`, so we recommend you poll this endpoint. After the data becomes available, this endpoint will always return a response immediately.

The same applies to the initial fetch for intervals via `/intervals`.

`Bill` data may take up to ten minutes to become available.
