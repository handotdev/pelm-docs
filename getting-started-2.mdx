## Registering for Pelm
TODO: update this

To start using Pelm, first register at [pelm.com/register](https://www.pelm.com/register). Your **Company** will be displayed to users in Connect (more details later). Upon successful account creation, you'll receive an email with your `Pelm-Client-Id` and `Pelm-Secret`.

<Info>Your `Pelm-Client-Id` and `Pelm-Secret` will be essential for making requests to Pelm. Please keep these secret and in a safe place.</Info>

If you need to update any of these fields or need help with anything else, email us at [info@pelm.com](mailto:info@pelm.com).

## Let's write some code
Now that you have a basic understanding of our core concepts, it's time to integrate Pelm.

If you're looking to start using Pelm in an existing application, follow the Connect Guide to embed our Connect component into your frontend and create your first `User`.

If you just want to get up and running ASAP, clone and follow along the ReadMe of our Quickstart Repo.
