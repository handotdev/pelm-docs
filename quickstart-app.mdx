## Introduction

You can run Pelm locally by cloning the Quickstart app. Youâ€™ll need API keys, which you can obtain [here](https://www.pelm.com/register).

After you clone the repo, you'll need to fill out the `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `USER_ID` variables in `constants.ts`.

```bash Terminal
git clone https://github.com/Pelm-Technologies/quickstart.git
cd quickstart

# fill out variables in constants.ts

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the app
npm start
```

After filling out the `client_id` and `client_secret`, the app will work out of the box.
