{/* ## What is Pelm? */}
Pelm is a universal API for utilities. We provide a single API that enables you to query energy data, such as electricity/gas usage intervals or bills, from any one of our supported utilities. We also provide an embeddable frontend component that allows your users to seamlessly and securely grant you access to their data.

Our API is organized around REST. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.


{/* // You can view the list of [supported utilities](/reference/utilities). If there's a utility that you need data from and would like to see next, get in contact with us at [info@pelm.com](mailto:info@pelm.com), and we'll be happy to chat. */}
