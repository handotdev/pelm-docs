title: "Connect Guide"
---

Connect is a UI component provded by Pelm that allows your users to seamlessly and securely connect their utility login.
The end goal of Connect is to obtain an `access_token`, which grants you access to a particular `User`'s data.

The Connect flow consists of the following screens:
1. Welcome Screen - User gains context on Pelm and Connect
2. Utility Selection Screen - User selects their Utility
3. Credentials Screen - User inputs their credentials
4. MFA Screen - Only shown for utilities that require multi-factor authentication


## Setting up Connect
This guide will walk through the following steps to getting Connect set up in your app:
1. Backend - Creating a `connect_token` to initialize Connect
2. Frontend - Initializing and opening Connect
3. Backend - Exchanging the `authorization_code` you obtained from Connect for an `access_token`

## 0. Install Connect

Either install our [React library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pelm-connect) or add a `<script>` tag.

<CodeGroup>

```bash React
npm install react-pelm-connect
```

```html HTML/JS
<script src="https://cdn.pelm.com/initialize.js"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>


## 1. Backend - Create a `connect_token`

The first step is creating a Connect token. This is an extra security measure that abstracts away information like your `Pelm-Secret` and `user_id` from the web client.

You must include your own unique identifier for your user in the query parameters. This identifier is required to get `User` info or delete `User`s via our `/users` endpoints. 

Include the optional `utility_id` parameter if you want your User to skip the Utility Selection Screen. You can find a list of `utility_id`s [here](/reference/utilities).

To retrieve a `connect_token`, make a POST request to the [/auth/connect_token](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/post%5Fauth-connect-token) endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```js Node.js
import express from "express";
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const app = express();
const port = 3001

app.post('/connect-token', (req, res, next) => {

  const headers = new Headers();
  headers.set('Pelm-Client-Id', PELM_CLIENT_ID);
  headers.set('Pelm-Secret', PELM_SECRET);

  const encodedParams = new URLSearchParams();
  encodedParams.set('user_id', USER_ID);

  const requestOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: encodedParams,
  };

  const response = await fetch('https://api.pelm.com/auth/connect-token', requestOptions);
  const body = await response.json();
  res.send(body);
})
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.pelm.com/auth/connect-token -H "Pelm-Client-Id: {CLIENT_ID}" -H "Pelm-Secret: {CLIENT_SECRET}" -F "user_id={YOUR_USER_ID}" -F "utility_id={UTILITY_ID}"
```
</CodeGroup>


## 2. Frontend - Initialize Connect

Initialize and open Connect on your frontend.

#### Config object

Pass your `connect_token` and callbacks to Connect via a config object.

| Parameter     | Type                                  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----- |
| connectToken  | `string`                               | Token generated in step #1. |
| onSuccess     | `(authorizationCode: string) => {}`     | Called when your User successfully connects their Utility login. |
| onExit        | `(status: string, metadata: any) => {}` | Called when Connect is exited. |

// TODO: somewhere that links to status

#### Open Connect

Once you've created the config object, you can initialize Connect in a few ways.

<CodeGroup>

```js React
import { useConnect, Config } from 'pelm-connect';

function App() {
  const config: Config = {
    // TODO: code for fetching connect_token
    connectToken: 'YOUR_CONNECT_TOKEN',
    onSuccess: (authorizationCode: string) => {...},
    onExit: (status: string, metadata: any) => {...}
  }

  const { open, ready, error } = useConnect(config);

  return <button
      type="button"
      className="button"
      onClick={() => open()}
      disabled={!ready}
  >
    Connect your utility
  </button>
}
```

```html HTML/JS
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Pelm Connect Javascript Demo</title>
        <script src="https://cdn.pelm.com/initialize.js"></script>
        <script defer>
            (async () => {
                // Create a connect token using client credentials in order to initiate the Connect Flow.
                const generateConnectToken = () => {
                  // Step 1
                };

                const connectToken = await generateConnectToken();
                // This is the callback that is called when your User successfully connects their utility account.
                const onSuccess = (authorizationCode) => {
                  // Step 3
                };

                // This is the callback that is called when Connect is exited but the user has not successfully connected their utility account.
                onExit = (status, metadata) => {};

                // The config is used to specify your Connect Token and callbacks for the success and exit cases.
                const config = {
                    connectToken,
                    onSuccess,
                    onExit,
                };
                const handler = window.PelmConnect.create(config);

                const connectUtilityButton = document.getElementById('connect-utility-button');
                connectUtilityButton.disabled = false;
                connectUtilityButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
                    handler.open();
                });
            })();
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Pelm Connect Javascript Demo</h1>
        <button id="connect-utility-button" disabled>Connect utility</button>
    </body>
</html>
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Backend - Exchange an `authorization code` for an `access token`
The final step is exchanging the `authorization_code` you received in the previous step for an `access_token` via [`POST /auth/token`]().

<CodeGroup>

```js Node
app.post('/authorization', async (req, res) => {

  const headers = new Headers();
  headers.set('Pelm-Client-Id', PELM_CLIENT_ID);
  headers.set('Pelm-Secret', PELM_SECRET);

  const encodedParams = new URLSearchParams();
  encodedParams.set('code', req.body.authorizationCode);

  const requestOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: encodedParams,
  };

  const response = await fetch('https://api.pelm.com/auth/token', requestOptions);
  const data = await response.json();
  const accessToken = data.access_token;
  // Save accessToken to database
})
```

```bash cURL
curl --data "code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}&grant_type=code" https://api.pelm.com/tokens -H "Pelm-Client-Id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -H "Pelm-Secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
```
</CodeGroup>

You should receive a response that looks like this.

```json JSON
{
  "access_token": "57f20230-4ee7-11ec-9b0c-acde48001122",
  "access_token_expires_in": 3600,  // ignore this
  "refresh_token": "aea9b417e72b3978c5bfcd0782c3a486ec63abf5e85ce9a62ba36d1b18b12488",  // ignore this
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 1314000  // ignore this
}
```

<Info>Note that the `access_token` **will not expire**. You should securely store this token in your database.</Info>
<Warning>You can ignore all the other fields in this response: `access_token_expires_in`, `refresh_token`, `refresh_token_expires_in`. They're included for legacy applications.</Warning>


## 4. Make your first request

Now that you have your `access_token`, you can start making requests for your user's data. Request your `User`'s accounts via [GET /accounts](https://pelm.readme.io/reference/get%5Faccounts).

This may return the following `500` response:

```json
{
  "error_code": "data_unavailable",
  "message": "We're currently loading data for this account, please try again in 5 minutes."
}
```

If this happens, wait around one minute and try again.

Note that receiving this response implies that you've successfully created an `access_token`. 
You can verify this by making the same request with an invalid `access_token` and receiving a `credentials_invalid` response.

## More Connect nuances
Connect has two modes: `create` or `update`. 
- `create` mode is used for creating new `User`s. Your user will see all of the screens listed above.
- `update` mode is used to update existing `User`s that have changed their utility password. Your user will start the flow at the Credentials Screen.

The flow is determined by the `user_id` value you pass when creating a `connect_token`. We will automatically determine which flow should be shown based on our records for the user.

If you submit a new `user_id` for a user that has already connected their account with you, your previously submitted `user_id` will be overwritten by the new value. Make sure you change this appropriately in your records.
