title: "Explo's Authentication"
---

Explo utilizes token-based authentication. To correctly make a call to the API,
you must include the Explo-Authorization header with a valid team token. Below
is an example of what the header would look like, replacing with a valid token.

```bash
'Explo-Authorization': 'Token <team_token>'
```

## API Tokens

You can create multiple API tokens with different levels of permissions and
access. On your team settings page, you can generate new tokens, refresh a
current token value, delete tokens, and edit these permissions.

### Permissions

Currently Explo supports two types of API Token permissions, read-only and
read-write. Granting a token read-write permissons will allow it to create,
delete, and edit any end user group in its access group, while granting a token
read-only permissions will only allow it to pull those end user groups.

For more information about how API tokens interact with their access group, see
[the access groups documentation](/managing-permissions/access-groups).
