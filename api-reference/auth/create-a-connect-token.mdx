### Form data

<ParamField body="user_id" type="string" required>

ID specified by you to identify the user. This allows you to refer to the User using an ID you already have, precluding the need to save a new user_id generated by Pelm.

Typically, clients will set their own db user_id as this value.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="utility_id" type="string" required>

Include this optional parameter if you already know which Utility your User uses. If included, the User will skip the Utility Selection Screen. If omitted, the User will need to select their Utility.

You can find a list of utility_ids here.
