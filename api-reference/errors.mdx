description: "Pelm uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success and codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, an address is invalid, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Pelm's servers."
