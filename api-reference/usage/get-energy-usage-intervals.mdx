title: "Get Energy Usage Intervals"
description: "Get a list of interval objects corresponding to energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions for a given `EnergyAccount` in a specific time range. Emissions data is currently only available for PG&E and SCE."
api: "GET /intervals"
---

The type of energy (gas vs. electric) is specified in the `type` query param. Information on whether this account has electricity and/or gas data is found in the `available_meter_type` field of the `Account` object, which can be queried via `/accounts`.

Timestamps are in UNIX time, usage is in the unit specified by the `usage_unit` for that account (otherwise kWh/therms if no unit is specified), and emissions is in kgCO2e (kg of carbon dioxide equivalent).

If neither `start_date` nor `end_date` are provided, the response will include usage data for the last two months.

If `start_date` is included but `end_date` is not, the response will include usage data for two months starting at `start_date`.

If `end_date` is included but `start_date` is not, the response will include usage data for two months ending at `end_date`.

Note that this endpoint was previously named `/accounts/{account_id}/intervals`, which is still live.

### Query Params

<ParamField query="account_id" type="string" required>
  Energy account id to query usage intervals for. `account_id`'s are returned in
  the `/accounts` response.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="type" type="string">
  Must be either `ELECTRIC` or `GAS`. Defaults to `ELECTRIC` if omitted.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="start_date" type="number">
  Start date of desired intervals in UNIX time
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="end_date" type="number">
  End date of desired intervals in UNIX time
</ParamField>

### Headers

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  `access_token` passed as "Bearer \{access_token}"
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Pelm-Client-Id" type="string" required>
  `Pelm-Client-Id` given on registration
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Pelm-Secret" type="string" required>
  `Pelm-Secret` given on registration
</ParamField>
