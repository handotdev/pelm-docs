## Base URL

Use the following endpoint as the base URL for all of the following endpoints

```bash
https://api.pelm.com
```

## Object types

### The User object

A `User` corresponds to a utility login. If your user has multiple utility accounts, e.g. PG&E and SCE, each one will correspond to a unique `User` object.

### The Account object

The `Account` object corresponds to an account under a utility login. If a user has a residential home, an investment home, and a vacation home, these would correspond to three different Pelm `Account` objects.

### Bills

A `Bill` corresponds to a utility bill for a single billing period.
